# REST API Design Principles That Stand the Test of Time

Great APIs feel boring in the best way: predictable, consistent, and easy to reason about. When the surface area is simple, teams ship faster and clients break less often.

This is a lightweight checklist you can keep in mind while designing new endpoints or reviewing an existing API.

## Core principles

- Use clear, consistent **resource names** (think nouns).
- Keep behavior aligned with **HTTP semantics** (read vs write).
- Return **consistent response shapes** so clients don’t guess.
- Prefer **sane defaults** with optional query parameters for filtering/sorting.

## A simple checklist

1. Pick stable resource paths (plural nouns are a common convention).
2. Use a small set of status codes consistently.
3. Document pagination and what “next/previous” means.
4. Be explicit about authentication and authorization requirements.
5. Add brief examples in docs for the “happy path” and common errors.

## Wrap-up

If you optimize for consistency first, your API will be easier to document, easier to test, and easier for others to adopt.
