# Mastering Remote Work: Productivity Tips

Remote work is less about “working from anywhere” and more about building routines that protect your focus and your energy. A few small defaults go a long way.

> Remote work works best when your day has clear starts, clear stops, and fewer context switches.

## Common challenges

- Home distractions
- Blurry work/life boundaries
- Fewer casual social touchpoints
- Async communication gaps

## Daily routine checklist (example)

| Habit | Why it helps
|------|--------------
| Dedicated workspace | Signals "work mode"
| Plan top 3 tasks | Reduces overwhelm
| Deep work block | Protects focus
| Walk / stretch break | Prevents burnout
| Shutdown ritual | Creates a clear end

## Tools (keep it minimal)

- [x] Pick one task tracker (e.g. Linear / GitHub Issues)
- [ ] Pick one notes app (e.g. Notion / Obsidian)
- [ ] Keep a single calendar (e.g. Google Calendar)
- [ ] Turn on Focus / Do Not Disturb during deep work
- [ ] Prefer async updates; use chat for blockers only

## Wrap-up

Start with one routine change (workspace + “top 3 tasks”) and one boundary (a daily shutdown time). Once those stick, iterate.
