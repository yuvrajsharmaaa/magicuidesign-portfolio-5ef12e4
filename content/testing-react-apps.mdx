# Testing React Applications: A Practical Guide

Tests are your safety net — they let you refactor with confidence and ship changes without fear. The goal is not “as many tests as possible”; it’s <mark>confidence in the critical paths</mark>.

If your test suite feels slow or fragile, it usually means you’re testing the wrong thing. In practice, you can ignore a lot of “perfect coverage” advice and focus on a few high-signal habits.

## What to test (a simple rule)

- **Unit tests**: small, fast checks for logic and pure functions.
- **Integration tests**: components + data + user flows (most value per test).
- **E2E tests**: a few happy-path checks across the whole app.

## High-signal testing habits

- Prefer user-facing assertions (what the user sees/does).
- Use accessible queries first (roles, labels).
- Mock at the boundary (network) instead of mocking implementation details.

## Things to avoid

- ~~Testing internal component state~~ when behavior is what matters.
- ~~Sprinkling test IDs everywhere~~ as a first choice.
- Overusing snapshots that fail for harmless UI changes.

## Wrap-up

Start small: one integration test for your most important flow, then add unit tests for tricky logic. Over time, your tests become living documentation that helps you move faster.
