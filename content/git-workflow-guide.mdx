# Git Workflow Guide: From Chaos to Clarity

Git is powerful, but teams usually struggle because they don’t agree on a few basics. A simple workflow keeps history readable, reviews focused, and releases less stressful.

This is a lightweight guide you can adopt in a day and iterate on later.

## A simple team workflow

- Branch from `main` for every change.
- Keep branches small and short-lived.
- Open a pull request early and ask for review.
- Merge back to `main` once tests pass.

## Commit message tips

- Start with a clear verb (“add”, “fix”, “remove”, “refactor”).
- Keep the first line short and specific.
- Prefer multiple small commits over one giant “WIP”.

## PR checklist

1. Explain what changed and why.
2. Link the issue or describe the user impact.
3. Add tests (or explain why not).
4. Keep the diff small enough to review quickly.

## Wrap-up

The goal isn’t “perfect Git” — it’s fewer surprises and faster collaboration. Start simple, write down the rules, and improve them as your team grows.
